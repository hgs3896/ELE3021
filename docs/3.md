# 3. Semaphore and Readers-Writer Lock Design in xv6

## A. Semaphore Design

### 1. What is semaphore?
> **Semaphore** is a kernel object that can hold an integer value as the number of threads that can access at the same time.

### 2. POSIX Semapore (unnamed semaphore)

#### Semaphore Type Definition for POSIX Semaphore
 - ```sem_t``` : A type representing a data structure for POSIX Semaphore

#### Semaphore Initializer for POSIX Semaphore
> Reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_init.html
```c
int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value);
```
 - Arguments
   - ```sem_t* sem``` : a pointer referring to the target unnamed semaphore object
   - ```int pshared``` : a nonzero pshared value means the semaphore(**sem**) is shared between other processes  
(In linux, a kernel object which indicates a semaphore is managed as a file descriptor, so it is possible to be shared like other kernel objects.)  
Otherwise, the semaphore is only shared between threads.
   - ```unsigned int value``` : a value of how many threads can access
 - Return Value
   - 0 if successful completion is done
   - -1 to set errno to indicate the error, otherwise
 - Behavior
   - Initialize an unnamed semaphore referred to by **sem** with a **value** and a **sharedness** given.

#### Semaphore Wait Operation for POSIX Semaphore
> Reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_wait.html
```c
int sem_wait(sem_t *sem);
```
 - Arguments
   - ```sem_t* sem```: a pointer referring to the target semaphore object
 - Return Value
   - 0 if successfully performed the semaphore lock operation on the semaphore designated by **sem**
   - -1 to set errno to indicate the error, otherwise
 - Behavior
   - Lock a semaphore
     - If the semaphore value is currently zero,
       - then the calling thread will not return from the call to sem_wait() until it either
         - locks the semaphore
         - or the call is interrupted by a signal.
     - Otherwise, it gets the lock, decrease its value, and returns.

#### Semaphore Post Operation for POSIX Semaphore
> Reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_post.html
```c
int sem_post(sem_t *sem);
```
 - Arguments
   - ```sem_t* sem```: a pointer referring to the target semaphore object
 - Return Value
   - 0 if successfully performed the semaphore unlock operation on the semaphore designated by **sem**
   - -1 to set errno to indicate the error, otherwise
 - Behavior
   - Unlock a semaphore
     - If the semaphore value resulting from this operation is positive,
       - no threads were blocked waiting for the semaphore to become unlocked
       - the semaphore value is simply incremented
     - Otherwise
       - one of the threads blocked waiting for the semaphore will be allowed to return successfully from its call to **sem_wait()**

### 3. Design for Basic Semaphore

#### Understand the behavior of semaphore

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Fold/Unfold the behavior of semaphore</summary>

To try to understand the behavior of binary semaphore,  
let's think about the situation where 3 threads are competing to acquire a semaphore.

1. 3 threads are competing to get a lock
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_1.png)

2. First thread gets the lock, but the others get asleep
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_2.png)

3. When first one finishes it job, it releases the lock
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_3.png)

4. It signals the other threads to be waken up
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_4.png)

5. The other 2 threads are competing to get the lock.
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_5.png)

6. Third one gets the lock and the other one gets asleep.
![Semaphore Design](/docs/images/sem_design_6.png)

</details>

#### Basic Design

By looking at the basic behavior of semaphore, I found that its behavior is similar to that of mutex(in xv6, sleeplock).  
To mimic the behavior, I applied the basic code of sleeplock in xv6 to build a scratch design of the semaphore.

##### Data Structure of Semaphore
```c
struct xem_t {
  int lock_caps;      // Capacity of this semaphore
  struct spinlock lk; // spinlock protecting this semaphore
};
```

### 4. Implementation of the Basic Semaphore

#### Initialize the semaphore object
```c
void
xem_init(xem_t *semaphore, int cap)
{
  initlock(&semaphore->lk, "semaphore");
  semaphore->lock_caps = cap;
}
```

1. Initialize the semaphore spinlock
2. Make the default value as one

#### Wait for other threads
```c
void
xem_wait(xem_t *semaphore)
{
  acquire(&semaphore->lk);
  while(semaphore->lock_caps <= 0) {
    sleep(semaphore, &semaphore->lk);
  }
  --semaphore->lock_caps;
  release(&semaphore->lk);
}
```

1. Acquire the spinlock for protecting semaphore
2. Check the remaining capacity of the semaphore
3-a. Sleep if there are not enough capacity (When sleeping, the spinlock will be automatically released)
3-b. Otherwise, decrease its capacity(value) and release the spinlock

#### Post for other threads
```c
void
xem_unlock(xem_t *semaphore)
{
  acquire(&semaphore->lk);
  ++semaphore->lock_caps;
  wakeup(semaphore);
  release(&semaphore->lk);
}
```

1. Acquire the spinlock for protecting semaphore
2. Increase the capacity(value)
3. Wake up the other threads sleeping for the current semaphore
4. Release the spinlock

### 5. Test of Semaphores

This test shows 3 scenarios.
1. Test without any synchronization
=> Since there is no synchronization, some data race might exist.
2. Test with synchronization of a binary semaphore
=> Since there is synchronization of a binary semaphore, the sequence in same numbers must be grouped.
3. Test with synchronization of a semaphore with 3 users
=> As at most 3 threads can be allowed, the data race might exist.

```text
$ test_sem
1. Test without any synchronization

```

## B. Readers-Writer Lock Design

### 1. What is readers-writer lock
> **Readers-Writer Lock** is a lock that enables multiple readers acquire the lock, but also allows only single writer to possess the lock.  
> It is efficient when there are plenty of read operations and a few write operations, since read operations themselves do not incur any race conditions.

### 3. Design of Readers-writer Lock using Semaphores

#### Understand the behavior of Readers-writer lock

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Fold/Unfold the behavior of readers-writer lock</summary>

1. There are 3 threads trying to acquire read lock
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_1.png)

2. Another thread(Thread 3) is trying to acquire the read lock
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_2.png)

3. Another thread(Thread 4) is trying to acquire the write lock
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_3.png)

4. Since there are 4 threads which acquired readlock for reading, Thread4 has to wait
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_4.png)

5. When all reader threads release their lock
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_5.png)

6. It signals Thread4 to be waken up
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_6.png)

7. Thus, Thread4 is able to acquire the write lock
![Readers-writer Lock Design](/docs/images/rwlock_design_7.png)

</details>

#### Basic Design

By looking at the basic behavior of readers-writer lock, my naive design is something with two locks(one for protecting itself, one for waiting for write). Also, there is the number of readers field that is needed to wake up the writer thread.

##### Naive Data Structure of Readers-Writer Lock
```c
struct rwlock_t {
  struct xem_t lk;    // Semaphore for protecting rwlock_t
  struct xem_t write; // Semaphore for writer lock
  uint num_readers;   // The number of readers
};
```

However, when there are multiple readers and writers waiting for a readers-writer lock, there must be a writer starvation problem.  
To tackle this issue, I added a field(num_writers) to count how many writers are waiting for that lock and if at least one writer is waiting, to acquire the read lock will be waiting for threads who needs writer lock.

##### Improved Data Structure of Readers-Writer Lock
```c
struct rwlock_t {
  struct spinlock lk; // Spinlock for protecting rwlock_t
  struct xem_t write; // Semaphore for writer lock
  uint num_readers;   // The number of readers
  uint num_writers;   // The number of writers
};
```

### 4. Implementation of Readers-writer Lock using Semaphores

#### Initialize the lock object
```c
void
rwlock_init(rwlock_t *rwlock)
{
  rwlock->num_readers = 0;
  rwlock->num_writers = 0;
  initlock(&rwlock->lk, "rwlock");
  xem_init(&rwlock->write, 1);
}
```

Initialize the locks and counters

#### Acquire Read Lock
```c
void
rwlock_acquire_readlock(rwlock_t *rwlock)
{
  int num_readers;

  acquire(&rwlock->lk);
  while(rwlock->num_writers > 0)
    sleep(rwlock, &rwlock->lk);
  num_readers = ++rwlock->num_readers;
  if(num_readers == 1)
    xem_wait(&rwlock->write);
  release(&rwlock->lk);
}
```

Similar with semaphore design, but if there are any writers waiting, go to sleep.  
Otherwise, increase the num_readers and hold a write lock for ensuring another write thread cannot hold the lock.

#### Release Read Lock
```c
void
rwlock_release_readlock(rwlock_t *rwlock)
{
  int num_readers;

  acquire(&rwlock->lk);
  num_readers = --rwlock->num_readers;
  if(num_readers == 0)
    xem_unlock(&rwlock->write);
  release(&rwlock->lk);
}
```

Decrease the number of readers and release the write lock if there are no readers.

#### Acquire Write Lock
```c
void
rwlock_acquire_writelock(rwlock_t *rwlock)
{
  acquire(&rwlock->lk);
  rwlock->num_writers++;
  release(&rwlock->lk);

  xem_wait(&rwlock->write);
}
```

Increase the number of writers and wait for holding a unique write lock using semaphore

#### Release Write Lock
```c
void
rwlock_release_writelock(rwlock_t *rwlock)
{
  xem_unlock(&rwlock->write);

  acquire(&rwlock->lk);
  rwlock->num_writers--;
  release(&rwlock->lk);

  wakeup(rwlock);
}
```

Decrease the number of writers and wake up the reader thread who wants to read

As you can see, there are reader threads reading the data and writer threads write the data, but there is no writer starvation problem.  
Since a writer can block the access of reader threads who request its read lock after the writer thread.

2. Lock Efficiency Test

This test compares the performance between a simple binary semaphore and readers-writer lock.

2. Lock Efficiency Test
        a. Using a simple binary semaphore
        b. Using a readers-writer lock

        Reader Elapsed Ticks 2-a) 17 ticks      2-b) 11 ticks
        Writer Elapsed Ticks 2-a) 4 ticks       2-b) 1 ticks
```
(NTHREADS = 10, READER_RATIO = 0.9)

2. Lock Efficiency Test
        a. Using a simple binary semaphore
        b. Using a readers-writer lock

        Reader Elapsed Ticks 2-a) 9 ticks       2-b) 19 ticks
        Writer Elapsed Ticks 2-a) 4 ticks       2-b) 7 ticks
```
(NTHREADS = 10, READER_RATIO = 0.7)

If the number of writers increases, the performance of readers-writer lock worsens due to its exclusiveness.
