# Light-Weight Process Design in xv6

## 1. Key Objectives of a LWP(Light-Weight Process)
 - To improve the multitasking capabilities of xv6 by implementing an abstraction of LWP.

## 2. Design Basic LWP Operations

### a) Brief Explanation about Process and Thread
 - Briefly explain about Process and Thread.
   - Process
     - A process is a running program which is independently executed by a scheduler and has its own resources such as address spaces and file descriptors.

   - Thread
     - A thread is a light-weight process(LWP) that shares the resources of its parent process such as address space and file descriptors with other LWP(s) belonging to the same parent process without excessive overhead.

 - Briefly explain about context switching in both sides.

   |Required?|Process|Thread(LWP)|
   |-:|:-:|:-:|
   |Switch registers|O|O|
   |Allocate/Deallocate stack segments|O|O|
   |Switch stack segments|O|X|
   |Switch heap segments|O|X|
   |Switch code segments|O|X|
   |Switch BSS/Data segments|O|X|
   |Visit the `scheduler` routine|O|X|
   |Invalidate page caches|O|X|

   Thus, using LWPs is a much efficient way to support concurrency!


### b) POSIX Thread
1. `int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);`
   - `pthread_create` is a **pthread** POSIX library call to create a POSIX thread object with some attributes(stack size, stack base address, scheduler policy, etc) specified by `attr` which starts at an entry point specified by `start_routine` with an argument(`arg`).
   - After it is called, the return value is either 0 when successful, or an error code if an error occurs during the creation of thread.
   - If a call to `pthread_create` is successful, the pthread_t object pointed by `thread` will have an ID of the newly created thread.

2. `int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **ret_val);`
   - `pthread_join` is a **pthread** POSIX library call to wait for the POSIX thread specified by `thread` to terminate by suspending its execution.
   - The return value of `pthread_join` is either 0 when successful, or a non-zero code to indicate the error otherwise.
   - The value passed to `pthread_exit` in the callee thread can be referenced by `ret_val` in the caller thread.

3. `void pthread_exit(void *ret_val);`
   - `pthread_exit` is a **pthread** POSIX library call for the callee thread to voluntarily terminate its execution.
   - The argument `ret_val` is for the caller thread to fetch the return value of the current callee thread.

### c) Design Basic LWP Operations for xv6

#### 0. LWP Control Block

##### 1. LWP Design
  ```mermaid
  stateDiagram
      LWP_UNUSED --> LWP_EMBRYO    : alloclwp
      LWP_EMBRYO --> LWP_UNUSED    : dealloclwp
      LWP_EMBRYO --> LWP_RUNNABLE  : thread_create, userinit, fork
      LWP_RUNNABLE --> LWP_RUNNING : swtchlwp1
      LWP_RUNNING --> LWP_RUNNABLE : yield
      LWP_RUNNING --> LWP_ZOMBIE   : thread_exit
      LWP_RUNNING --> LWP_SLEEPING : sleep
      LWP_SLEEPING --> LWP_RUNNABLE: wakeup, kill
      LWP_ZOMBIE --> LWP_UNUSED    : thread_join
  ```
  In order to reuse the structure of `struct proc`, keep the states with the process states

###### 0. LWP Identifier
  ```typedef uint thread_t;```

###### 1. LWP States
  ```c
  enum lwpstate {
    LWP_UNUSED,
    LWP_EMBRYO,
    LWP_SLEEPING,
    LWP_RUNNABLE,
    LWP_RUNNING,
    LWP_ZOMBIE,
  };
  ```

###### 2. LWP Structure
  ```c
  struct lwp {
    thread_t tid;            // LWP Identifier
    thread_t ptid;           // Parent LWP ID
    uint stack_sz;           // Size of stack memory (bytes)
    enum lwpstate state;     // LWP State
    char *kstack;            // Bottom of kernel stack for this lwp
    struct trapframe *tf;    // Pointer to its trapframe
    struct context *context; // Pointer to its context
    void *chan;              // Channel to fall a sleep
    void *ret_val;           // Return value
  };
  ```
To follow the parent-child relationship of LWPs, add a **ptid** field.  
Also, using the base(lwp_idx in `struct proc`) and bound(stack_sz in `struct lwp`) approach to the stack memory management, managing stack memory becomes simple.

###### 3. Proc Structure
  ```
  struct proc {
    uint sz;                     // Size of process memory(including text, data/bss, heap) (bytes)
    ...
    int lwp_idx;                 // Current LWP index
    struct lwp *lwps[NLWPS];     // LWPs
    int lwp_cnt;                 // LWP counter
    struct sleeplock lock;       // Lock object for exec
  };
  ```

###### 4. Changing Layout of xv6 memory model

    In order to expand the stacks as much as possible, I changed the layout of xv6 memory model from (code->data->stack->heap) to (code->data->heap->...->stack_N->stack_N-1->...->stack_0)

- (Before) Stacks can only grow up to 2 pages

| Address | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0x80000000 | ... | 
| ... | ... |
| 0x???????? | (empty page) |
| 0x???????? | Heap | 
| 0x???????? | Stack 0 | 
| 0x???????? | Stack 0(unused) |
| 0x???????? | BSS/Data | 
| 0x00000000 | Code | 

- (After) Each stack is able to grow up to 6 pages

| Address | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0x80000000 | (empty page) | 
| 0x7ffff000 | Stack 0 |
| 0x7fffe000 | Stack 0(unused) |
| 0x7fffd000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fffc000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fffb000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fffa000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fff9000 | Stack 1 | 
| 0x7fff8000 | Stack 1(unused) |
| 0x7fff7000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fff6000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fff5000 | (empty page) |
| 0x7fff4000 | (empty page) |
| ... | ... | 
| 0x???????? | Heap | 
| 0x???????? | BSS/Data | 
| 0x00000000 | Code |

#### 2. Interaction with other services in xv6
- a) Interaction with system calls in xv6
  1. exit
    - Behaviors
      - All LWPs are terminated
      - All resources used for each LWP must be cleaned up
      - The kernel should be able to reuse LWP at a later point of time
      - No LWP should survive for a long time after the exit system call is executed
    - Implementation of **exit**
      - Close unclosed file descriptors
      - Stop all LWPs by changing all LWPs' states with `LWP_ZOMBIE`
      - Set the current process state to `ZOMBIE` for its parent process to destroy it
    - Test Results
      ```
        5. exittest1 start
        thread_exit ...
        thread_exit ...
        tthread_exit ...
        thread_exit ...
        thread_exit ...
        thread_exit .tttttttt
        5. exittest1 finish

        6. exittest2 start
        6. exittest2 finish
      ```

  2. fork (Not fully implemented)
    - Behaviors
      - A new process must be created according to the fork’s behavior even if multiple LWPs call the fork system call at the same time
      - The address space of the LWP must be copied normally
      - You should also be able to wait for the child process normally by the wait system call
      - Note the parent-child relationship between processes after the fork
    - Implementation of **fork**
      - Use a process-level sleeplock to protect **fork** action
      - Allocate a new process control block
      - Copy process state from proc.
      - Allocate LWP control blocks as much as the new process needs
      - Copy every LWP content of current process to LWPs of new process
      - Copy the user stacks and kernel stacks of all LWPs
      
  3. exec
    - Behaviors
      - If you call the exec system call
        - the resources of all LWPs are cleaned up
          - so that the image of another program can be loaded and executed normally in one LWP
          - At this time, the process executed by the exec must be guaranteed to be executed as a general process thereafter.
    - Implementation of **exec**
      - Use a process-level sleeplock to protect **exec** action so only one thread can execute the program
      - Load another program from the storage
      - Allocate page tables for the new process
      - Set the current LWP as the main LWP by swapping LWP control block
      - Remove other LWPs
      - Clean up its old page table
    - Test Results
    ```
    7. exectest start
    echo is executed!
    7. exectest finish
    ```
      
  4. sbrk
    - Behaviors
      - Memory areas must not be allocated to overlap with each other when multiple LWPs simultaneously call the sbrk system call to extend the memory area
      - Memory areas should not be allocated a space of a different size from the requested size
      - The expanded memory area must be shared among LWPs
    - Implementation of **sbrk**
      - Use a lock(ptable.lock) in growproc to handle concurrent sbrk calls as sequential sbrk calls
      - Due to changing the layout of xv6 memory model, it is possible to expand the heap segment as much as the physical memory allows
    - Test Results
    ```
    8. sbrktest start
    8. sbrktest finish
    ```
      
  5. kill
    - Behaviors
      - If more than one LWP is killed
        - All LWPs must be terminated
        - The resources for each LWPs in that process must be cleaned up
      - After a kill for a LWP is called
        - No LWP in that group should survive for a long time
    - Implementation of **kill**
      - When a LWP gets a signal of kill, its process's killed flag gets enabled.
      - It automatically calls exit()
    - Test Results
    ```
    9. killtest start
    9. killtest finish
    ```
      
  6. pipe
    - Behaviors
      - All LWPs must share a pipe
      - Reading or writing data should be synchronized and not be duplicated
    - Implementation of **pipe**
      - This need not to be changed, since pipe operations in xv6 already satisfy thread-safety
    - Test Results
    ```
    10. pipetest start
    10. pipetest finish
    ```
      
  7. sleep
    - Behaviors
      - When a specific LWP executes a sleep system call, only the requested LWP should be sleeping for the requested time
      - If a LWP is terminated, the sleeping LWP should also be terminated.
    - Implementation of **sleep**
      - After calling **sleep**, call either swtchlwp1 to switch to another LWP or to <u>kscheduler</u> to support LWP-level sleeping
    - Test Results
    ```
    1.  sleeptest start
    2.  sleeptest finish
    ```

- c) Other corner cases
  - Creating a LWP in one LWP
    - Behaviors
      - Create a LWP in the same process
    - Implementation of **Creating a Thread in Thread**
      - By managing the thread in the parent-child relationship, **thread_exit** will wake up the parent LWP and abandon its child LWPs to main LWP(0)
    - Test Results
      ```

  - Recursive creation of LWPs in a chain of LWPs (Not fully implemented)
    - Behaviors
      - Stop recursive creation of LWPs until the number of LWPs reaches to the number of NUM_OF_MAX_LWPS_PER_PROCESS
    - Design of **Recursive creation of LWPs**
      - `thread_create` returns a negative number when the number of LWPs reaches to its maximum.
      - `thread_create` sets the joinable state of `thread` with **not joinable**, so the `thread_join` will not join this LWP.
    - Test Results
      ```
